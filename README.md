1. Make a folder under the root of the project called `data`.

```
mkdir data
```

2. Download data files from Kaggle into the `data` folder from `https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data` so they won't be sync-ed to the repo.

```
cd data

wget https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/download/stage1_sample_submission.csv.zip
wget https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/download/stage1_test.zip
